    <p style="text-align: center;">Hello I am Jamie. I engage in traditional human activities such as consuming books, watching music and reading games. The reason I (a human) was interested in this course is because I am interested in IT in general but i have always liked coding and thought this would be a great opportunity. I may also or may not be starting a cult but im keeping it on the down-low atm:)</p>
